### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="281" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete-a 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

This is a **partial diagram** of the UI component. This diagram gives a high level view of the structure.

<img src="images/Ui_High_Level.png" width="850" />

We also have a **partial diagram** to show the dependencies between the higher level UI components (such as `InternPanel`), and the lower level components (such as `InternshipRolePanel` etc.).

<img src="images/Ui_Low_Level.png" width="500" />

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `selectedViewPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Assignment`, `InternshipRole` or `InternshipTask`  objects residing in the `Model`.

Below is a **partial diagram** to show the dependency on the `Model` class:

<img src="images/Ui_Lower_Level_2.png" width="500" />

The `UI` component is responsible for the following key features:

***View Changes***

* Listen for different view changes, using the respective inputs when users call the respective list commands
* Update the UI accordingly to display the selected view

***Calendar***

* Whenever a user performs an add, or delete operation, update the names of the tasks in the calendar accordingly
* Switching between different calendar months using buttons

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `AddAssignmentCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddAssignmentCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add an assignment).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<img src="images/DeleteAssignmentSeq.png" width="850"/>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteAssignmentCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` 
(`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddAssignmentCommandParser`) which uses the other classes 
shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddAssignmentCommand`) which the 
`AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddAssignmentCommandParser`, `DeleteAssignmentCommandParser`, ...) inherit 
from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

**Overall high level view of the Model component**
<img src="images/Model_High_Level.png" width="450"/>

**Assignment portion of the Model component**
<img src="images/Model_Low_Level_Assignment.png" width="400"/>

**Internship portion of the Model component**
<img src="images/Model_Low_Level_Internship.png" width="550"/>

The `Assignment`, `InternshipRole`, `InternshipTask` components:

* these components implement the Unique Interface.
* stores the address book data i.e., all `Assignment`, `InternshipRole`, `InternshipTask` objects (are contained in a separate `UniqueList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' component objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an 
unmodifiable `ObservableList` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as these components represent data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)



### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="650" />

The `Storage` component plays a crucial role in your application by handling the persistence of data, specifically address book data and user preference data, in JSON format. 
It provides methods to save this data and retrieve it, converting it into corresponding objects when needed. This section will provide an overview of the Storage component, 
its key features, dependencies, and the classes it interacts with.

The Storage component is responsible for the following key features:

* Data Serialization: It can save data, such as address book entries and user preferences, in JSON format. Serialization is the process of converting these data objects into a structured text format, making them suitable for storage and future retrieval.

* Data Deserialization: It can read data back from the storage, deserialize it, and recreate corresponding objects. This feature is essential for restoring the application's state from previously saved data.

* Inheritance from AddressBookStorage and UserPrefStorage: The Storage component is designed to be versatile. It inherits from both AddressBookStorage and UserPrefStorage, allowing it to be treated as either one, depending on whether you need to work with address book data or user preference data. This inheritance simplifies the codebase by providing a single entry point for storage operations, regardless of the data type.

**Dependencies**

The Storage component relies on certain classes from the Model component, as its primary responsibility is to manage the persistence of objects that belong to the model. Currently, these classes include:

* JsonAdaptedAssignment: This class is used to store assignment data in a format suitable for JSON serialization. It is essential for saving and retrieving assignment-related information.

* JsonAdaptedInternshipRole: To store internship role data. This class ensures that internship roles can be saved and restored accurately.

* JsonAdaptedInternshipTask: This class handles the serialization and deserialization of internship task data. It is crucial for maintaining the integrity of internship-related information.

These dependencies illustrate the close relationship between the Storage and Model components, as the Storage component is responsible for managing the persistence of data associated with the Model.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

The implementation for `InternshipRole` and `InternshipTask` are very similar to `Assignment`, hence we only detail the implementation for `Assignment` features.

### Add Assignment feature

#### What it does 
{: .no_toc}

Adds a assignment to the list of currently existing assignments. Users are able to add any valid assignment to the list. 
If a record of the same assignment already exists in the list, the command will not be allowed and an error will be thrown to alert user.

Example Use: `add-a n/Assignment 1 e/2023-11-11 16:00 d/Important Assignment s/complete p/2023-11-10 t/Individual`

#### Implementation 
{: .no_toc}

Upon entry of the add assignment command, an AddAssignmentCommand class is created. The AddAssignmentCommand class extends the abstract 
Command class and implements the `execute()` method. 

Before execution of this method, the `verifyView()` method is called, to verify that the user is in the `Assignment` view

Upon execution of this method, an `Assignment` object is added to the model’s list of assignments if all the attributes provided are 
valid and a duplicate instance does not exist.

After the addition of the new assignment, the assignments are sorted by deadline automatically.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the add assignment command behaves at each step.

Step 1. User launches the application

Step 2. User executes `add-a n/Assignment 1 e/2023-11-11 16:00 d/Important Assignment s/complete p/2023-11-10 t/Individual` to save a new assignment.

Step 3. The assignment is added to the model’s list of assignments if valid.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the add assignment operation works:

<img src="images/AddAssignmentSeq.png" width="850" />

* `args`: Refers to a valid sequence of arguments provided by the user.

### Delete Assignment Feature

#### What it does
{: .no_toc}

Deletes a assignment at the specified **one-based index** of list of currently existing/found assignments. Users are able to
delete any assignment in the list. If an index larger than or equal to the size of the assignment’s list is provided, the
command will not be allowed and an error will be thrown to alert user.

Example Use: `delete-a 1`

#### Implementation
{: .no_toc}

Upon entry of the delete assignment command, a `DeleteAssignmentCommand` class is created. The `DeleteAssignmentCommand` class
extends the abstract `Command` class and implements the `execute()` method. 

Before execution of this method, the `verifyView()` method is called, to verify that the user is in the `Assignment` view

Upon execution of this method, the assignment at specified **one-based index** is removed if the index provided is valid.

After the deletion of the specified assignment, the assignments are sorted by deadline automatically.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the delete assignment command behaves at each step.

Step 1. User launches the application

Step 2. User executes `delete-a 1` to delete the assignment at index 1 (one-based indexing).

Step 3. The assignment at this index is removed if the index provided is valid.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the delete assignment operation works:

<img src="images/DeleteAssignmentSeq.png" width="850" />

### Edit Assignment Feature

#### What it does
{: .no_toc}

Users can edit the description of the specific assignments in the list by providing the new description. Existing `description` value will be
updated to the new values. The assignment to be edited can be specified through the assignment's index.

Example Use: `edit-a i/1 d/New description`

#### Implementation
{: .no_toc}

Upon entry of the edit assignment command, an `EditAssignmentCommand` class is created. The `EditAssignmentCommand` class extends
the abstract `Command` class and implements the `execute()` method. A new `Assignment` object is created with the new description, 
with the attributes of the old `Assignment` object copied over. 

Before execution of this method, the `verifyView()` method is called, to verify that the user is in the `Assignment` view

Upon execution of `EditAssignmentCommand`, an `Assignment` object is added to the model’s list of assignments if all the attributes 
provided are valid.

The following activity diagram illustrates the user flow for editing an assignment:

<img src="images/EditAssignmentActivityDiag.png" width="400" />

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the edit assignment command behaves at each step.

Step 1. User launches the application

Step 2. User executes `edit-a i/1 d/New description` to edit an assignment.

Step 3. The assignment is edited and saved to the model’s list of assignments if valid.

Step 4. filteredAssignmentList is updated so that the UI can display the edited assignments.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the edit assignment operation works:

<img src="images/EditAssignmentSeq.png" width="850" />

### Mark Assignment Feature

#### What it does
{: .no_toc}

Changes the `status` of an assignment at the specified **one-based index** of the assignment list from `incomplete` to `complete`. 
If the index provided are larger than size of the list, the command will not be allowed and an error will 
be thrown. If specified assignment is already `complete`, the command will not be allowed and an error will be thrown.

Example Use: `mark-a 1`

#### Implementation
{: .no_toc}

Upon entry of the mark assignment command, a `MarkAssignmentCommand` class is created. The `MarkAssignmentCommand` class extends the 
abstract `Command` class and implements the `execute()` method. 

Before execution of this method, the `verifyView()` method is called, to verify that the user is in the `Assignment` view.

Upon execution of this method, the `status` assignment at specified **one-based index** is updated to `complete`.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the mark assignment command behaves at each step.

Step 1. User launches the application

Step 2. User executes `mark-a 1` to change the status of the assignment index 1 to `complete`.

Step 3. If the index provided is valid and assignment is currently `incomplete`, the assignment at index 1 is updated to be `complete`

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the mark assignment operation works:

<img src="images/MarkAssignmentSeq.png" width="850" />

### UnMark Assignment Feature

#### What it does
{: .no_toc}

Changes the `status` of an assignment at the specified **one-based index** of the assignment list from `complete` to `incomplete`.
If the index provided are larger than size of the list, the command will not be allowed and an error will
be thrown. If specified assignment is already `incomplete`, the command will not be allowed and an error will be thrown.

Example Use: `unmark-a 1`

#### Implementation
{: .no_toc}

Upon entry of the mark assignment command, a `UnMarkAssignmentCommand` class is created. The `UnMarkAssignmentCommand` class extends the
abstract `Command` class and implements the `execute()` method.

Before execution of this method, the `verifyView()` method is called, to verify that the user is in the `Assignment` view.

Upon execution of this method, the `status` assignment at specified **one-based index** is updated to `incomplete`.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the unmark assignment command behaves at each step.

Step 1. User launches the application

Step 2. User executes `unmark-a 1` to change the status of the assignment index 1 to `incomplete`.

Step 3. If the index provided is valid and assignment is currently `complete`, the assignment at index 1 is updated to be `incomplete`

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the unmark assignment operation works:

<img src="images/UnmarkAssignmentSeq.png" width="850" />

### Find Assignment Feature

#### What it does
{: .no_toc}

Finds a assignment with the specified parameters.

Example Use: `find-a CS2100`

#### Implementation
{: .no_toc}

Upon entry of the find assignment command, a `FindAssignmentCommand` class is created. The `FindAssignmentCommand` class 
takes a predicate created by `AssignmentContainsKeywordsPredicate` class. The `FindAssignmentCommand` class extends the abstract 
`Command` class and implements the `execute()` method which updates the model's list of filtered assignments.

Before execution of this method, the `verifyView()` method is called, to verify that the user is in the `Assignment` view

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the find assignment command behaves at each step.

Step 1. User launches the application

Step 2. User executes `find-a CS2100` to find an assignment with `CS2100` in the name.

Step 3. The model's list of filtered assignment is updated.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the find assignment operation works:

<img src="images/FindAssignmentSeq.png" width="850" />

* `args`: Refers to a valid sequence of arguments provided by the user. 

### List Assignment Feature

#### What it does
{: .no_toc}

Lists all assignments, if no parameters are specified, or lists only the assignment with deadline within the specified parameters.
It will also change the view from `Internships` to `Assignments` (if applicable).

Example Use: `list-a s/2024-01-01 12:00 e/2024-02-02 12:00`

#### Implementation
{: .no_toc}

Upon entry of the list assignment command, a `ListAssignmentCommand` class is created. The `ListAssignmentCommand` class
takes a predicate created by `AssignmentBetweenStartandEndPredicate` class. The `ListAssignmentCommand` class extends the abstract
`Command` class and implements the `execute()` method which updates the model's list of filtered assignments.

On execution, the `ListAssignmentCommand` class calls the `setView()` method of the `Model` class, to change the view to `Assignments` (if necessary).

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the list assignment command behaves at each step.

Step 1. User launches the application

Step 2. User executes `list-a s/2024-01-01 12:00 e/2024-02-02 12:00` to filter the assignment list to show assignments between 
`2024-01-01 12:00` and `2024-02-02 12:00` inclusive.

Step 3. The model's list of filtered assignment is updated.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the list assignment operation works:

<img src="images/ListAssignmentSeq.png" width="850" />

* `args`: Refers to a valid sequence of arguments provided by the user.
