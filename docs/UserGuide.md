### Notes about the GUI

In order to use any `assignment` commands, you must first switch to the assignment view (using `list-a`). Otherwise, you will receive an error message. 

In order to use any `internship` commands, you must first switch to the internship view (using `list-i`). Otherwise, you will receive an error message.

The calendar will only display tasks for the selected month, up to a maximum of 2 for each day. Names that are too long will be truncated.

While there are clickable buttons such as the calendar navigation button and the options on the menu bar, CampusCompanion is a CLI-focused application, and as such, implements commands to do the same thing.
For example:
- ``Help`` can be achieved using the ``help`` command.
- ``File -> Exit`` can be achieved using the ``exit`` command.

## CampusCompanion Tutorial (for new users)

This is a tutorial for new CampusCompanion users. This tutorial will provide you step-by-step instructions for how to use each
command for both assignments and internships. 

1. Launch CampusCompanion. You may refer to the instructions [here](#getting-started).
2. Let's change the view to see assignments first. Enter the command `list-a`
![NewUserTutListA.png](images%2FNewUserTutListA.png)
3. Let's try **adding an assignment** to CampusCompanion. Enter the command
`add-a n/CC tutorial 1 e/2023-11-29`
![NewUserTutAdd1.png](images%2FNewUserTutAdd1.png)

4. Add a few more assignments. Try out filling optional parameters as well, etc
 - `add-a n/CS2100 Assignment 1 e/2023-11-30 13:00 t/Coding`
 - `add-a n/CC optional 1 e/2023-11-29 16:00 d/try this out! s/complete p/2023-11-27 t/Optional`
   - Note: On adding assignments, they will automatically be sorted by their deadlines.
   The assignment due earliest will be first in the assignments list, which can be viewed using `list-a`

   ![NewUserTutAddMoreAssgn.png](images%2FNewUserTutAddMoreAssgn.png)

5. Let us try editing the description of `CC tutorial 1` to say `nice descriptive description!`.
In the example above, `CC tutorial 1` is in index 2, so we do `edit-a i/2 d/nice descriptive description!`
![NewUserTutEdit.png](images%2FNewUserTutEdit.png)

6. We are done with `CC tutorial 1`! Let's now mark it as complete. First, let's try using `find-a` to filter and narrow
down the list. We can do `find-a tutorial` to filter the assignments list to show only assignments that
contain `tutorial`
![NewUserTutFind.png](images%2FNewUserTutFind.png)

7. Then, we use the index shown in the list (in this case, `CC tutorial 1` is at index 1) and do `mark-a 1` to mark the assignment as completed
![NewUserTutMark.png](images%2FNewUserTutMark.png)

8. To see all our assignments again, let's do `list-a`
![NewUserTutList.png](images%2FNewUserTutList.png)

9. Lastly for our assignments, let's delete our `CC tutorial 1` as we no longer want to track it.
With reference the picture above, we will do `delete-a 2`
![NewUserTutDelete.png](images%2FNewUserTutDelete.png)

10. Now, let's change the view to see internships. Enter the command `list-i`
![NewUserTutListI.png](images%2FNewUserTutListI.png)

11. Similar to assignments, we can add internship roles (under applications) and tasks! Let's add a few roles now using the command `add-i-role`
 - `add-i-role n/Google r/SWE c/Summer 2024`
 - `add-i-role n/FaceBook r/DevOps c/Winter 2024 d/Impress Mr Mark p/9500 o/follow-up l/Florida`
![NewUserTutAddIRoles.png](images%2FNewUserTutAddIRoles.png)

12. Now, let's add in some tasks relating to our roles, with `add-i-task`
 - `add-i-task n/OA i/1  e/2023-11-30 11:30` 
 - `add-i-task n/Interview i/1 e/2023-12-10 16:00 o/follow-up`
 - `add-i-task n/OA i/2 e/2023-11-29 17:30 s/complete o/follow-up`
![NewUserTutAddITasks.png](images%2FNewUserTutAddITasks.png)

13. We can also mark tasks as complete with `mark-i` and edit tasks and roles using `edit-i-task` and `edit-i-role` respectively. Let's try!
 - `mark-i 2`
 - `edit-i-task i/1 o/awaiting`
 - `edit-i-role i/1 c/Winter 2024 d/Prepare for google questions p/12500 l/Labrador Park`
![NewUserTutMarkEditI.png](images%2FNewUserTutMarkEditI.png)

14. Lastly, let's find Google with `find-i-role google` and delete the completed Google OA task with `delete-i-task 1`
![NewUserTutFindDeleteI.png](images%2FNewUserTutFindDeleteI.png)

15. We can view our internships list again with `list-i`
![NewUserTutLastListI.png](images%2FNewUserTutLastListI.png)

16. Congratulations! You are now ready to use CampusCompanion.

### How to use the internship outcome
**Q**: What is the recommended usage of the internship outcomes 
**A**: Outcome must be either one of the following only: `follow-up`, `ghosted`, `rejected`, `offered`, `accepted`, `awaiting`. This is how we recommend using them: 
- Awaiting (Just finished with one stage and awaiting results of that stage)
- follow-up (Just received a follow-up - e.g. for an interview, but haven't finished that round yet.
  Once finished with that round, the status should be updated to awaiting to indicate that you are awaiting results.)
- Ghosted (If you did not receive any news after an appropriate amount of time.)
- Rejected (If you received a rejection letter)
- Offered (If you are offered the internship)

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later 
switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the 
`preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
